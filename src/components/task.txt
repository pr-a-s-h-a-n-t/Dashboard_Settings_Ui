A. Problem Statement  

1.Create pages, matching the high-fidelity wireframe on Figma

2.Fetch/Download the “Schema.json” JSON located at here. 

3.Generate the map channels form by using “channels” key - values in schema.json and for additional settings use data inside “optionals” key values. 
For select element options (Primary and Ref Channels) use any 10-12 any random strings values which can be selected there.

4.Add backup channels button will open a collapsible dropdown and will have the same Primary and Ref channel select element.
 Repeat the same process like above here as well.


5.In Preview page if someone clicks on Edit Channels then go back to step two which is channel config/Map Channels page. 
Make sure that you use Global State Context / Redux to manage the data/state globally and save channels configurations to local storage in real time. 
So that if the user close the browser and comes back you have to load those settings again. 

6.After preview and third step completion, show the save page and disable the edit buttons there and show notification as per figma design.
Responsiveness of the pages would be a plus point.
